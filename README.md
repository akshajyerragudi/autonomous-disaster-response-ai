# Autonomous AI for Disaster Response (In Progress)

This is an early-stage project where I’m exploring how to use small devices like a Raspberry Pi and camera to help with disaster response — things like finding people or navigating through collapsed areas.

## Goal
Build a low-cost robot that can:
- Detect people or obstacles using computer vision
- Move on its own (autonomous)
- Run everything on-device using edge computing (no internet)

## Why I'm Doing This
I’m interested in robotics and computer engineering, and I wanted to try applying AI to something that could actually help people in real-world situations, like earthquakes, wildfires, and other situations.

I’m still learning a lot, so I’m reaching out to professors to try and get guidance or contribute to research in this space.

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- Python, maybe some C++
- OpenCV or TensorFlow Lite
- Raspberry Pi or Arduino with sensors

## What’s Next
- Test object/person detection with OpenCV
- Build a basic prototype that can move and react
- Document the whole process here as I go

This isn’t a finished project — it’s just the start. I’m using this repo to track everything and hopefully connect with researchers who are working on similar problems.
